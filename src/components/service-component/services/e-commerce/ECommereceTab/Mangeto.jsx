              Magento is a big advantage when it comes to e-commerce if your
              websiteâ€™s retail business is struggling to control costs because
              Magento is an open-source solution used for e-commerce
              applications. Yes, the big retail websites do use this system
              which was formerly owned by the Varien company but if you are a
              small player trying to compete against the big boys then every
              cent you save counts in the long run. Because of this even major
              auction site eBay recognizes the usefulness of being associated
              with Magento (eBay has already bought out 100% ownership of
              Magento). So maybe you should too as well.{" "}

              There is more to e-commerce than just boring financial data that
              make your eyes glaze over. A website devoted to e-commerce wants
              to know what its customers are thinking and Magento can do that
              through its Magento Mobile service. With Magento Mobile, your
              business will be able to develop your own apps that can work for
              hand in glove with your online retail operations. So what does
              that mean? It means these native apps can help your customers gain
              a better online e-commerce experience while you get more data on
              what customers are buying and what are being ignored. You can
              create retail business apps that will run on Android gadgets as
              well as iPads and iPhones. This is a big advantage if you want to
              shave off losing products and stick to products that you know your
              customers are willing to pay for.{" "}
