              Augmented Reality has become one of the next big moves in the
              application sector. What we see surrounding us is the world in its
              most natural form and augmented Reality is exactly the opposite of
              the same. It is a dual mixture of digital and the real world that
              gives inception to the new world. What AR does is that it adds
              advancement to certain components like sound, picture & images,
              motion along with GPS data to make the view more alluring
              meanwhile informative. It lies in the phantom between VR and
              reality blotting the line that makes the difference about what is
              computer generated and what is real by improvising the usersâ€™
              senses. Generally, augmented reality represents a changed view of
              reality by augmenting the elements or components in context to the
              environment. With the help of AR technology, users find themselves
              in the middle of a digitally manipulating and interactive
              surrounding that can be masked into the real world.{" "}
