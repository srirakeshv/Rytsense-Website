              PHP stands for Hypertext Processor. It denotes a server’s side
              scripting language. The applications with this programming
              language can run on web servers without relying on online
              browsers. This language is analogous to the C language created in
              1995 by Rasmus Lerdorf.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not too long ago, some skeptics believed that PHP had outlived
              itself, and it was about time other languages replaced it.
              However, their predictions didn’t come true. According to
              statistical data, over 70% of websites with well-known programming
              languages use PHP.

            </h1>
            <p>
              PHP is a classic scripting language for backend programming. It is
              an open-source language capable of embedding within HTML
              documents. It is primarily used for web development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of the most popular websites written with PHP include
              Wikipedia, Facebook, Instagram, Zoom, Tumblr, and Pinterest.
              Statistics show over 71% of websites with PHP use the seventh
              version. PHP 5 is available on 24.3% of the websites, while the
              remaining 4% have version three and the latest version, eight.

                  PHP is compatible with all operating systems, including Linux,
                  macOS, Solaris, and the most popular, Windows. Servers like
                  Apache, IIS, and iPlanet also support it.

                  The most popular database used by PHP developers is MySQL.
                  However, PHP can easily integrate with other databases like
                  Informix and Oracle DB.

                  The previous versions of PHP had some security concerns, but
                  the latest ones have higher safety. Moreover, PHP allows you
                  to use content management systems with a particular emphasis
                  on security.

                <p>
                  PHP is a great language for websites and applications.
                  However, if you want a more extensive technology like machine
                  learning, artificial intelligence, or big data analytics, PHP
                  isn’t the language for you.

                  If you want to be creative in your development project, PHP
                  isn’t the right tool for you. As a scripting language, PHP
                  doesn’t allow modifications or framework changes in the core
                  behaviors of applications. It means it will be difficult for
                  you to achieve desired outcomes.

                <li className="ml-10 font-bold text-2xl">Lack of Security</li>
                <p>
                  Because PHP is an open-source language, the older versions
                  have an ASCII text file. Such files are easily accessible. As
                  a result, the code you write can be seen by others, along with
                  the bugs it contains. Malicious elements can use this
                  information against you.

                <p>
                  PHP is easy to master, and with some practice, every developer
                  can get the hang of it. However, it is written like code,
                  which can be confusing for beginners. On the other hand,
                  Python is written in English, which makes it more suitable for
                  beginners with little experience.

                Moreover, using PHP development tools that helps you create
                online forums. As a result, many famous internet resources
                prefer PHP. For example, in 2002, Yahoo abandoned C/C++ language
                in favor of PHP.

                Among other things, PHP is also used for creating inner parts of

                updates for PHP and its support systems. For example, the Zend

                platforms, which are used to create APIs and external program
                interfaces. Laravel and Symfony frameworks are also used for

                The dedicated hiring model allows you to hire dedicated
                developers from tech service providers on a long-term basis.
                Therefore, this hiring model has specific terms and conditions
                when it comes to working hours, payment rates, and the dedicated
                team.
              </p>
              <p>
                While most of the time, the dedicated PHP developers work from
                the vendor’s site, there are times when they have to work from
                the customer’s site. Moreover, the client has the authority to
                assign their project manager the tasks of overseeing the
                activities of the development team.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the dedicated hiring model, the vendor shortlists resources
                based on the client’s requirements and project specifications.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because it is a contract between two parties, all the details
                should be negotiated at the start. It includes the recurring
                payment method for the hired talent and the overhead charges,
                which also include administrative costs. The costs also

                Javascript development or CSS coding. A PHP developer works hard

                A beginner is new to PHP. All they can offer is basic knowledge
                of PHP while being able to build some functionalities. However,

              <p>
                It is no secret that the open-source nature of PHP makes it the
                top choice for developers. One can install it to their system in
                no time and without any added charges. It also opens the door
                for various PHP frameworks like Laravel and Symfony. Moreover,

                With a professional PHP developer, you can start right away,
                irrespective of the browsers and machines your business has. PHP

                there are times when they, too, need help. This is where PHP

              <p>
                PHP communities have developers from all across the globe. In
                these online circles, developers share their experiences and
                suggestions for taking on different projects. As a result, your
                PHP developer doesn’t run out of ideas and solutions, regardless

              <p>
                Software development is a complex process that involves various
                cross-functional teams. Therefore, the PHP code must be spot-on.
                If the code is weak or flawed, it can affect the
                cross-functional execution, thus resulting in the failure of the
                entire development cycle.

                A dedicated PHP professional avoids any loopholes in the

                time-to-market, and eliminate all the bugs so there are very few
                to deal with. With professionally designed PHP code, the
                cross-functional execution becomes punctual and efficient, which
                increases the feasibility of the end product.

              <p>
                The skill set of a PHP developer can be divided into two areas.
                The first part revolves around technical knowledge of PHP and
                its frameworks, XML, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript/AJAX. They must
                also be comfortable working on different databases like Oracle,
                MySQL, and MongoDB.
              </p>
              <p>
                They should also have knowledge of PHP design patterns. If a
                developer has knowledge and experience working on eCommerce
                platforms, content management systems, and WordPress, you
                mustn’t let them go. They must also have knowledge of tools like
                PHPUnit and Composer.
              </p>
              <p>
                The other aspect revolves around softer skills like
                communication, teamwork, and time management. They must also
                have the attitude and the capabilities to resolve conflicts in
                the workplace. A PHP developer should also be able to think out
                of the box to develop creative and innovative solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hiring PHP professionals can be a cumbersome ordeal for several

              <p>
                Lumen is a PHP microframework by Laravel. While Laravel is a
                comprehensive full-stack PHP framework, Lumen is lightweight,
                fast, and has no complex configuration requirements or routing
                parameters. Lumen uses Laravel’s syntax, but it has a limited
                number of third-party integrations. It also doesn’t have a PHP
                template engine.

                  For developers with hands-on Laravel experience but who don’t
                  want to use an MVC framework, Lumen is a lighter alternative.
                  Interestingly, Lumen can be upgraded to Laravel.

                <li className="ml-10">
                  Lumen is most commonly used for creating loosely-coupled
                  microservices and effective PHP APIs.

                <li className="ml-10">
                  Despite its fast response times, Lumen is less flexible and

                web services created using Slim are minimalist in their
                architecture. It comes with a high-quality HTTP router and
                supports PSR-7 HTTP message implementations and dependency
                injection.

                Flight is a popular micro-framework that was designed to be
                extensible. It comes with a set of default methods and
                components. It enables you to register map methods and classes
                while overriding the existing classes and map methods. Because
                of its RESTful nature, Flight isn’t ideal for large-scale
                development projects. The developer must work on PHP 5.3 or
                above to use this framework.

                  independently made. Moreover, PHPixie hasn’t been updated
                  since 2018, and while it is still in use, it isn’t the

                Apart from hiring a PHP professional, businesses can outsource
                their PHP development projects. Let’s look at the benefits of
                outsourcing projects to PHP development companies.

                Access to a Bigger Talent Pool
              </h1>
              <p>
                When you outsource a development project to a PHP development
                company, you are no longer confined to your geographical
                location. Instead, you open your business up to international
                exposure in terms of talent. Outsourcing your PHP development
                enables you to work with development teams worldwide. While
                hiring a dedicated PHP developer is helpful, outsourcing allows
                you to expand your horizons and broaden your scope.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is a fact that some places outside the US have emerged as
                software development powerhouses in recent times. Furthermore,
                by working with professionals in different parts of the world,
                you become aware of the latest advancements in PHP development.
                It will provide you with fresh new perspectives and ideas that
                the local community might struggle to offer.

                Integrate In-House Teams with External Support
              </h1>
              <p>
                You might have an in-house PHP development team, but it doesn’t
                mean you can’t outsource certain projects to PHP development
                companies. While your in-house team works on a long-term
                project, external development support can help you efficiently
                meet deadlines on some projects. Moreover, if your business
                wants to release a product by a certain date, and the in-house
                development team is occupied with other projects, an external
                development team can come to the rescue.
              </p>
              <p>
                Interestingly, an external development partner can integrate
                with your in-house PHP developers. For example, they both can
                work together on your company’s website. They can decide which
                responsibilities must be assigned to which developer while
                deciding how they will communicate to streamline work
                activities.

                Round-the-Clock Support
              </h1>
              <p>
                With so many people working remotely worldwide, PHP
                professionals can communicate with one another at any given
                time. Furthermore, if you work with an external development team
                in another country, they will provide round-the-clock services,
                no matter when needed. Platforms like Slack and WhatsApp can be
                useful. Just shoot a message, and they will respond in a timely
                fashion.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is a fact that external development teams will make
                themselves as available as possible, but you will have to
                consider the time zone discrepancies. For example, if you are
                working with a development team in Asia or the Middle East, you
                will be sleeping while they work and vice versa. On the other
                hand, if you work with a nearshore development company like the
                ones in Latin America or Canada, you won’t have to worry about
                time zone differences.
              </p>
              <h1 className="mt-3 font-bold text-xl">Increases Security</h1>
              <p>
                PHP is one of the most secure languages. However, it doesn’t
                mean that it is invincible. When you assign your development
                project to an outside team, they will take security very
                seriously. Most external development teams have seasoned
                developers with years of experience in using languages. They
                will know all the weak areas and will address them accordingly,
                thus protecting your websites and applications from malicious
                attacks.
              </p>
              <p>
                These developers also have safeguards in place to address any
                vulnerabilities. A common protection tool against malicious
                elements is Content Security Policy (CSP), which protects your
                sites and applications against attacks like Cross-Site Scripting
                (CSS).
              </p>
              <h1 className="mt-3 font-bold text-xl">A Dedicated Team</h1>
              <p>
                No matter what you do, dedication is a key ingredient in any
                line of work. When you outsource your PHP development projects
                to an external team, you won’t have to monitor their activities
                or micromanage them 24/7. As a result, you will have more time
                at your disposal to take care of other business functions while
                checking up on the development team occasionally. You can enjoy
                this level of relaxation because the contractor handling your
                project has a dedicated team of developers that invest their
                time and resources into your project.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dedication is the reason businesses approach external
                development teams. Because their in-house development
                professionals have their own projects, they don’t have the time
                to take on more projects. They will likely mess up their
                existing projects by jumping into more projects.

                Decreased Time to Market
              </h1>
              <p>
                It is important to build a website or an application as quickly
                as possible to decrease its time to market. It allows you to
                keep your business activities ahead of the curve while dealing
                with competition in an effective manner. After all, you wouldn’t
                want your competitor to release a similar product before you
                because of delays in your production.
              </p>
              <p>
                Generally speaking, PHP helps you create web resources
                efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, when you assign a
                development project to an external development team, you shorten
                the time-to-market. External development teams don’t have other
                business responsibilities to take care of. Therefore, they are
                committed to designing your product, saving a lot of time.
                Moreover, their skills and experience make them used to turning
                around projects quicker than expected.

              <p>
                Most companies set out to look for external development teams
                without doing their research. Some of them are only focused on
                cost efficiency. Despite the fact that cost is a crucial
                ingredient in the entire development process, it isn't the only
                one, and focusing too much on cost can result in failure. There
                are several things a business needs to focus on. Things like
                their vendor’s expertise, portfolio, reviews, and feedback from
                past clients cannot be ignored.
              </p>
              <p>
                Make sure you research enough to find out what your development
                partner has done so far. You can even ask them for individual
                resumes of their team members to understand better what you are
                getting into.
              </p>
              <h1 className="mt-3">

                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                You must do a lot of research before the initial interview. The
                rest of the information will be given to you when the external
                development partner communicates with your IT team. After some
                thorough analysis and homework, it will appear to you whether or
                not this external development team is able to handle your
                project and how well they will perform.
              </p>
              <p>
                The time you spend researching your outsourcing options should
                correlate with the project's magnitude, the investment size, and
                the time you have to deliver the final product.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, if you plan on making a simple mockup, you can
                spend three to four months researching. On the other hand, if

                Avoid Ambiguity and Miscommunication
              </h1>
              <p>
                Sometimes, businesses outsource their development projects
                without knowing what needs to be done. As a result, their
                requirements remain ambiguous, which confuses the developers, as
                they don’t have a clear picture of what they must do. Moreover,
                it becomes difficult for the business and its outsourcing
                partner to determine whether things are heading in the right
                direction.
              </p>
              <h1 className="mt-2">
                Before jumping into a development project with an outsourcing
                partner, here are a few simple questions to ask.
              </h1>
              <ul className="list-disc">
                <li className="ml-10">
                  What are the goals surrounding this project?
                </li>
                <li className="ml-10">Do we have a defined workflow?</li>
                <li className="ml-10">
                  Is the product ready to be made available across multiple
                  platforms?
                </li>
                <li className="ml-10">Do we have the required content?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Besides, before initiating things with an outsourcing partner,
                you must thoroughly discuss the end goal and the approval
                systems. The outsourcing partner must have a clear idea of what
                you want for them to do complete justice to your project.
              </p>
              <h1 className="mt-3 font-bold text-2xl">
                Hire Companies With Knowledge of the Latest Trends
              </h1>
              <p>
                Assigning development jobs to outsourcing partners with little
                or no knowledge of the latest trends can be disastrous. While
                they may look like a company that codes better than anyone else,
                they might use workflows confined to a specific area. Their lack
                of knowledge surrounding the latest trends will affect how end
                users interact with the product.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is worth noting that no region is better than the other.
                Still, it is important to check if the outsourcing partner meets
                expectations beyond work ethics, legal risks, broadband
                capacities, cultural differences, and similar technicalities.
              </p>
              <h1 className="mt-3 font-bold text-2xl">
                Gain Technical Knowledge
              </h1>
              <p>
                Companies work with outsourcing development partners because of
                their skills and expertise. However, you cannot expect to place
                an order and get the exact same result. You need to keep a check
                on whether or not the project is going according to plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                To do this, you need to have a basic understanding of the
                technical side of PHP development. A lack of knowledge on your
                part can give birth to some major issues in terms of how the
                final product will be.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you run a startup and you don’t have the knowledge or the
                expertise to supervise a development project, you must have an
                in-house PHP developer that can monitor the progress on your
                behalf.
              </p>
              <p>
                Having an in-house team of developers is helpful, but if you are
                in a leadership position, you must have some technical knowledge
                of PHP development.
              </p>
              <h1 className="mt-3 font-bold text-2xl">
                Don’t Underestimate Quality Assurance
              </h1>
              <p>
                Monitoring the progress of a development project increases the
                likelihood that the final product will meet your expectations.
                In fact, you should have a tester from the very beginning of the
                project that identifies loopholes and troubleshoots them
                promptly. Otherwise, be prepared to discover several bugs in the
                end.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are two things you can do for quality assurance. You can
                either make sure the outsourcing company has a QA department, or
                you can hire a QA team that makes sure ongoing outsourcing
                projects are technically sound.

                Outsourcing PHP Development VS Bringing It In-House: A Cost
                Perspective
              </h1>
              <h1 className="font-bold text-xl">In-House PHP Development</h1>
              <p>
                For hiring in-house developers, you must devise a strategy with
                your HR team. You must identify the number of software
                architects, QA staff, database engineers, business analysts, and
                BI engineers you will need in the team.
              </p>
              <p>
                You must give your in-house team financial assistance like paid
                sick leaves, annual bonuses, insurance, and overtime
                compensation, not to forget the money you will spend to provide
                them with resources and infrastructure to do their jobs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of the most important cost components of hiring an in-house
                PHP development team are as follows:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc">
                <li className="ml-10">Staff salary</li>
                <li className="ml-10">Cost per hire</li>

              <h1 className="mt-3 font-bold text-2xl">Wrapping Up</h1>
              <p>
                As you can see the dedicated PHP development team can create a
                huge impact on your project. If you want to achieve
                much-anticipated success, nothing else can make you more
                successful than the team of dedicated PHP developers. You will
                get a chance to leverage their experience, development

              <p>
                PHP has high development speed, and it is easy to use. It also
                offers cross-platform compatibility and integration
                capabilities. Moreover, unlike the older versions, the new
                versions are more secure.

                2) What Are the Downsides of PHP Development?
              </h1>
              <p>
                It lacks versatility, has limited debugging tools, and its core
                behaviors cannot be modified. Secondly, Security breaches are
                common in older versions. Lastly, there are easier alternatives
                like Python.

              <p>
                A beginner-level developer makes around $20, while an
                intermediate-level developer makes approximately $30. A senior
